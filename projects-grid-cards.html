Working as a team of 5 over the course of a weekend during this competitive event, we successfully developed a working prototype, as well as an application visualizing the data collected by BayHax. My involvement was to develop the infrastructure between BayHax and the application and graphing the data using the Chart.js library. BayHax’s data, which pertained to emotional states such as anger, sadness, and joy, were charted and cross-referenced with time and interactions with the buttons. While developed during a hackathon, BayHax’s primary focus was to help parents to better understand the emotional state of their children, allowing them to track times and dates when their child might be experiencing a particular emotional state.<br></p>

                        <p class="text-center"><strong>Summary</strong><br>“Borb’s Big Adventure” is a reflexive response and physics-based game played as a side-scrolling adventure. Developed during the game development research project under Dr. T. Krause at the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, Borb’s Big Adventure was meant to help children learn more about momentum and kinematic forces by playing as Borb, the ball-orb-round-marble-cat. My task was to develop the grappling movement mechanism, which was used as a way for the player to manipulate a rope with tension in order to “grapple” to their goal. After 6 months of development, Borb’s Big Adventure was demoed at the 2020 WiSys Quick Pitch UW- Stevens Point competition where it&nbsp; earned a research grant to continue the project. One of the biggest challenges of this project was the many various aspects the project took on: for example, there was a significant amount of visual design, simulated kinematics versus actual kinematics, and more. Borb’s Big Adventure was developed in the Unity Game Engine using C#, and developed collectively by Dr. Krause’s research team.<br></p>

Informing the public about potential spread will help ensure that they are protecting themselves appropriately. Concurrently, predictions of high numbers of future cases may encourage lawmakers to consider implementing or increasing stimulus checks and other forms of relief.<br><br></p>

                        <p class="text-center"><strong>Analysis</strong><br>By recognizing trends collected by an AI facial recognition algorithm, particular determinations could be reliably made about one’s emotional state at a certain date and time. What I treasure most about this project was picking up a new technology and employing it quickly to a relevant and impactful application. This project also drew me closer to the applications of artificial intelligence in hardware projects; the possibility to apply collected data to effectively predict emotional responses was particularly interesting to me. Working on BayHax was also one of my first and most valuable experiences of working on a technical challenge with a team right out of high school. Our team --HexHax-- used our shared experience from Google CSSI in order to craft a solution that rocked the leaderboards. If I could, I would take more responsibility in the project itself, and take on more of a leadership role.<br><br></p>

                        <p class="text-center"><strong>Analysis</strong><br>Incorporating physics into a virtual environment (as a 2D video game) was a difficult feat; one that involved a significant amount of debugging and refining. As a programmer on the team, I was charged with the movement mechanics of the game, including jumping, walking or rolling, and some work on grappling. This project became one of the best experiences I ever had in resolving algorithmic solutions to complicated situations; such as where a tether should render, and which direction the centripetal acceleration of a bouncing circular kitten should be, which inspired me to pursue increasingly complicated and more impactful projects to become involved in.<br><br></p>
